# Lucia's idea (with additions from Viktor)

https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Marvel_Database

Network over the marvel universe characters.

Edges: character

Nodes: relationship between characters but this could be friends, family or even enemies.
    - If two characters have an edge to each other, this means that they have some kind of relationship - either met in real life, fought together, fought against each other, etc.
    - If only one character has an edge to another, this means that they know of each other but have never met in person - OR they have heard of that character through stories, legends, etc.

Ideas for analysis:
    - Centrality measures to find the most influential characters in the Marvel Universe.
    - Community detection algorithms to identify groups of characters that are more densely connected to each other.
        - Here, we could maybe find characters that belong in different multiverses via the communicites.
        - Or different Marvel story arcs, for instance, spiderman and his stories, antman, the avengers or guardians of the galaxy or dr strange and his universe.
    - Sentiment analysis on the character pages... is the character a villain or a hero? Or neutral?

# Another idea:

- Network of professors
- Nodes: professors
- Edges: professors who have collaborated on papers together or cited each other in their work.

Here, see if we can find communities of professors who work in similar fields or have similar research interests.
Also, use centrality measures to find the most influential professors in the network (those who have many citations or collaborations).
Sentiment analysis could be done on the abstracts of their papers to see if there are any trends in the tone or sentiment of their research.


# Viktor's idea

Network of politicians.

nodes: politicians

edges: affiliation, same opinions maybe?


Analysis:

- Determine the politicians with the most influence using centrality.
- Attempt to identify political parties, factions or other alliances using communities.
- Determine political enemies could be interesting too.
- If opinions on some topics are included, determine if opinions determine communities
