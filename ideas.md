# Lucia's idea (with additions from Viktor)

https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Marvel_Database

Network over the marvel universe characters.

Edges: character

Nodes: relationship between characters but this could be friends, family or even enemies.
    - If two characters have an edge to each other, this means that they have some kind of relationship - either met in real life, fought together, fought against each other, etc.
    - If only one character has an edge to another, this means that they know of each other but have never met in person - OR they have heard of that character through stories, legends, etc.

Ideas for analysis:
    - Centrality measures to find the most influential characters in the Marvel Universe.
    - Community detection algorithms to identify groups of characters that are more densely connected to each other.
        - Here, we could maybe find characters that belong in different multiverses via the communicites.
        - Or different Marvel story arcs, for instance, spiderman and his stories, antman, the avengers or guardians of the galaxy or dr strange and his universe.
    - Sentiment analysis on the character pages... is the character a villain or a hero? Or neutral?
