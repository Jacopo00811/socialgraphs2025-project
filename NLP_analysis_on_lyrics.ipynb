    "> Easy thing is to find common words and themes (REMEMBER we are given the genre attribute already).\\\n",
    "> Can NLP account for the mood and sentiment? Even if it is a love song, it could be very sad.\\\n",
    "> Do artists in the same genre also use similar words?\\\n",
    "> Do artists who use similar words tend to collaborate more often? (or artist with the same sentiment and mood)\\\n",
    "> Can genre be guessed from lyrics and sentiment?\\\n",
    "> We also see how well do artists actually represent their genres IF genres can be guessed from lyrics alone? - like sometimes it genre is more a \"sound, music\" style rather than lyrical style.\n",

    "Definitions:\n",
    "> Artist sentiment is the average of the top 5 songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things we should be careful of:\n",
    "> Since we take artists above a popularity threshold - we should address that this analysis may be limited or closed off.\\\n",
    "> REMEMBER: we already have genres as attributes but the NLP does not know it ofc."
